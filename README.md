# laptop-setup
Some utils to help build Unix based laptops.

## mac-homebrew-setup.bash

This script installs a bunch of common utilities that suits the way I work.
You can use this as a framework script and easily modify the list of utilities.

This should work with Mac OS X and probably Linux too (untested).
